Crowdstorming Data Project

These are R files and data files related to the Open Science project Crowdstorming Research: Many analysts, one data set 
(more info here https://osf.io/gvm2z/)

data.csv contains the main data file supplied at osf containing player-referee dyadic data

modelling1.R is the primary analysis script being used (very sloppy coding)

BernBeta and HDIofCDF are modified versions of simple Bayesian functions from Kruschke (2012)

the .Rproj file is vestigial...
